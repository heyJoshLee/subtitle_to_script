1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,440
Let's look at some grammar now.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,980
So the first grammar is "hurts."

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:06,320
"hurts"

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,000
So hurts is a verb

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,380
and here's a crab pinching the boy's nose.

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,080
He can say, "help! It hurts."

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,680
It hurts...

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,420
or you can say

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,340
"Her knee hurts."

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,320
'Her knee hurts."

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,540
So maybe you fall and you can say,

12
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:31,820
"Oh! My leg hurts."

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,340
My hand hurts.

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,400
Maybe you see your friend

15
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,640
and it's hard for him to hold things with his hand

16
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,860
you can say, what's wrong?

17
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,720
he says, "my hand hurts."

18
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,640
It hurts very much.

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,820
ah..."ache"

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,700
"ache"

21
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,480
"Ache" is very similar to hurts.

22
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,420
Ache can be a verb or a noun.

23
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,500
So ache is something that hurts.

24
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,620
So you can say,

25
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,940
"His head aches so much"

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,360
or "he has a headache."

27
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,200
or...

28
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,440
This ache is very severe.

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,260
So ache can be a verb or a noun.

30
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,000
Usually when we use "ache" as a noun.

31
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,660
We usually say what aches?

32
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,660
I have a headache.

33
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,780
I have a toothache

34
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,980
or maybe your doctor can ask you

35
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,320
Do you have any aches or pains?

36
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,800
And you can say, "Yes, doctor."

37
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,300
Everyday I have a headache.

38
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,960
My head hurts so much.

39
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,160
I hope that is not you.

40
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,580
I hope you don't have headaches everyday.

41
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:55,920
"pay"

42
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,420
"pay"

43
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,800
Is to pay money.

44
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,360
You can pay money here.

45
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,860
Pay money at the store.

46
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:14,980
She pays her bill with a credit card or a card.

47
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,260
"pay"

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,600
"Pay can also be use to talk...

49
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,100
talk about visiting something.

50
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,720
You can say I paid the doctor a visit.

51
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,520
Which means I visited a doctor.

52
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,840
But pay, usually means to pay money.

53
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,580
You have to pay money.

54
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,940
You can't just leave with out paying for the bread.

55
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,320
"stop"

56
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,840
"Stop" is to stop moving.

57
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,380
So move, move, move, move, stop.

58
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,940
Move, stop.

59
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,100
So they stop for security checkpoint.

60
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,340
So you are driving your car, you see a stop sign

61
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,680
says stop.

62
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,220
You have to stop.

63
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,120
"take"

64
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:12,640
"take"

65
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,660
"take"

66
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,680
So take is to grab something

67
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,960
or to take something.

68
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,500
This first is taking a cookie.

69
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,280
This person is taking something from the box.

70
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,740
"take"

71
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:36,720
"take"

72
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,320
He's taking her order.

73
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,160
So take isn't always you have to pick something up.

74
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,720
So she is giving him her order.

75
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,800
She says, I want to eat ahh...

76
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,800
one bowl of soup

77
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,540
and he says

78
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,620
I can take your order.

79
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,920
So he will write your order.

80
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,380
He takes your order.

81
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,520
He listens to you and he takes your order

82
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,480
and goes and

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,280
gives it to the cook

84
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,980
and the cook makes your food

85
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,600
so that's take.

86
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,040
"Taking"

87
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,520
Can also be use for

88
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,080
to ride something.

89
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,100
I am taking the bus today.

90
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,620
She is taking a taxi to the store.

91
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,900
I am taking my bike

92
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,080
so

93
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,760
taking or take

94
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,860
has many uses,

95
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,480
to ride

96
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,240
or to pick something up

97
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:35,880
or

98
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,400
to receive something.

99
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,300
All are okay

100
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,980
for using the word take.
